This project was developed to design a modern and user-friendly clothing shopping website.

It was designed using HTML and CSS, and thanks to its responsive design, it works seamlessly across devices.

A simple interface and easy navigation structure were implemented to enhance the user experience.

This project was created to develop basic web design skills and contribute to my portfolio.
